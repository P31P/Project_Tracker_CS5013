# Project_Tracker_CS5013
Course project for CS5013 : Programming with AI

A tracker for Raman Lab (DSAI, IIT Madras): it tracks projects and ideas, archives paper links from Slack automatically, and searches across all of them.

## Status
Project skeleton in place (Spring Boot, Postgres, CI). No features yet.

## Run locally
Needs Java 21, Maven and PostgreSQL with a `tracker` database (see [SCAFFOLDING.md](SCAFFOLDING.md), Step 0).
```bash
mvn verify
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring-boot.run.profiles=local
```
Then open http://localhost:8080.

## Configuration
Settings live in `src/main/resources/application.yml`. Override them with env vars or a local `.env`: `DB_URL`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `PORT`.
